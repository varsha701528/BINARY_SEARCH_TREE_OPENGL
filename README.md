# BINARY_SEARCH_TREE_OPENGL
1. There exist 3 files :
    a)bin.cpp
    b)draw.h
    c)bst.h
2. bin.cpp :Implements the general structure of the binary search tree
3. draw.h :Program to draw the tree on openGL.Gets the tree root from bin.cpp file.
4. bst.h :Just creates a basic BST to be used for the program.Returns a pair containing the root and the height of the tree

Lines between nodes are drawn using Bresenham Line drawing and circular nodes are drawn using midpoint algorithm
The program also includes menus.
It implements the 3 traversals (inorder,preorder,postorder).

TO RUN:
1. I used codeblocks for running the program.
2. Explicitly install the opengl libraries.(Download the glutming.zip file)
